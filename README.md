## Hi there 👋
My name is Gayle — a Cybersecurity and Information Assurance student focused on showcasing the hands-on skills I’ve developed through coursework, labs, and real-world projects.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on hands-on cybersecurity labs, including Active Directory environments, SIEM deployment with Splunk, and network security monitoring.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for automation, Azure fundamentals (AZ-900), and advanced security operations concepts.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Former classroom teacher with 5 years of experience — strong communicator who enjoys breaking down complex technical topics.
